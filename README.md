<h2>ICC Men's T20 World Cup Data Analysis</h2>
This project is all about data analysis on the ICC Men's T20 World Cup. The goal of the project is to gain insights and understanding about the different teams and players that have participated in the tournament.

<h3>Data Collection</h3>
The data for this project was scraped from <a href=https://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/team/match_results.html?id=2022%2F23;trophy=89;type=season>espncricinfo</a> using the Beautiful Soup library. The data includes details about the matches played, the teams and players involved, as well as various performance statistics.

<h3>Data Cleaning</h3>
The scraped data was then cleaned and processed using the Pandas and NumPy libraries. This involved tasks such as handling missing values, removing unnecessary columns, and formatting the data in a suitable format for analysis. The cleaned data was then imported into PowerBI using Power Query, and a data model was created to facilitate the analysis and visualization of the data.

<h3>Data Visualization</h3>
Using the data model and visualizations in PowerBI, the project created various charts and graphs to help understand the performance of the teams and players over the years. These visualizations included bar charts, line graphs, and scatter plots.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
This project demonstrates the process of collecting, cleaning, and visualizing data for the ICC Men's T20 World Cup using a variety of tools and techniques. Power Query and data modeling were used to import and prepare the data in PowerBI, and various visualizations were created to gain insights and understanding about the teams and players involved in the tournament. The insights and understanding gained from the data analysis can be used to inform future strategies and decisions related to the tournament.
