The data for this project was scraped from <a href=https://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/team/match_results.html?id=2022%2F23;trophy=89;type=season>espncricinfo</a> using the Beautiful Soup library. The data includes details about the matches played, the teams and players involved, as well as various performance statistics.
